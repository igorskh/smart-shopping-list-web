ReactJS-based shopping list with basic functionallity, string analysis and fuzzy search of products. Check out a [live demo](https://inez.roundeasy.now.sh).

If you have not received this project by clonining from git, check out the [repository](https://github.com/igorskh/smart-shopping-list-web).

## Features

-   Basic functions - add, remove items, change quantity
-   Basic natural language processing for detection of quantities and metrics
-   Fuzzy search of products in a database based on Levenshtein distance
-   Merging items of the same content
-   Animated graphical user interface
-   Save/Restore items to/from the browser local storage

## Implementation

### Project Structure

Folder `src/Datasets` contains `json` files with sample data:

-   [quantity_types.json](src/Datasets/quantity_types.json) - set of possible quantity types
-   [products.json](src/Datasets/products.json) - sample set of products

Folder `src/Helpers` contains main logic of the app

-   [HMatcher.js](src/Helpers/HMatcher.js) - implementation of fuzzy search in datasets
-   [HStrings.js](src/Helpers/HStrings.js) - strings manipulations

### Language Processing

When user types anything in the input field in [Components/AddProductForm.js](src/Components/AddProductForm.js), the following process runs:
1. Detect qunitites such as `1kg`, `1 liter`, etc. using a regular expression. Split number from a word, such as `1kg` to `1` and `kg`. 
2. Search word in a database using fuzzy search. If the word exsits in the list of metrics, use it as an quantity type.
3. Remove quanitity from the string, such as `1 liter of cold sweet milk` becomes `of cold sweet milk`
4. Remove typical prepositions (of, for): `cold sweet milk`
5. Search string in a database using fuzzy search, first all words, then removing first word and so on, `cold sweet milk` => `sweet milk` => `milk`. Until string is found in a database.
6. Repeat procedure with a reversed string `milk sweet cold` => `sweet cold` => `cold`
7. Use part which is found in a database as a product name `milk` and the rest as a description `cold sweet`

### Synonyms Search

Each entity, quantity type of a product has fields `ref` and `refType`.

```json
    "kartoffel": {
        "ref": "potatoes",
        "refType": "synonym"
    },
    "potatoes": {
        "title": "ðŸ¥”Potatoes",
        "defaultMetric": "kilogram",
        "defaultQuantity": 1
    },
```

If product, for example `kartoffel` has `refType` = `synonym`, synonym search method will take all properties from the product specified in `ref`. This process repeats reccursively until `refType`, `ref` is missing or `refType` != `synonym`.
