## Features

-   Basic functions - add, remove items, change quantity
-   Basic natural language processing for detection of quantities and metrics
-   Fuzzy search of products in a database based on Levenshtein distance
-   Merging items of the same content
-   Animated graphical user interface
-   Save/Restore items to/from the browser local storage

## Implementation

### Project Structure

Folder `src/Datasets` contains `json` files with sample data:

-   [quantity_types.json](src/Datasets/quantity_types.json) - set of possible quantity types
-   [products.json](src/Datasets/products.json) - sample set of products

Folder `src/Helpers` contains main logic of the app

-   [HMatcher.js](src/Helpers/HMatcher.js) - implementation of fuzzy search in datasets
-   [HStrings.js](src/Helpers/HStrings.js) - strings manipulations
-   [HSuggestions.js](src/Helpers/HSuggestions.js) - suggestions search

This app has datasets stored in JSON, which should not be the case in a real app, some more effecient way, such as sqlite or backend server should be used.

### Language Processing

When user types anything in the input field in [Components/AddProductForm.js](src/Components/AddProductForm.js), the following process runs:
1. Detect qunitites such as `1kg`, `1 liter`, etc. using a regular expression. Split number from a word, such as `1kg` to `1` and `kg`. 
2. Search word in a database using fuzzy search. If the word exsits in the list of metrics, use it as an quantity type.
3. Remove quanitity from the string, such as `1 liter of cold sweet milk` becomes `of cold sweet milk`
4. Remove typical prepositions (of, for): `cold sweet milk`
5. Search string in a database using fuzzy search, first all words, then removing first word and so on, `cold sweet milk` => `sweet milk` => `milk`. Until string is found in a database.
6. Repeat procedure with a reversed string `milk sweet cold` => `sweet cold` => `cold`
7. Use part which is found in a database as a product name `milk` and the rest as a description `cold sweet`

### Synonyms Search

Each entity, quantity type of a product has fields `ref` and `refType`.

```json
    "kartoffel": {
        "ref": "potatoes",
        "refType": "synonym"
    },
    "potatoes": {
        "title": "ðŸ¥”Potatoes",
        "defaultMetric": "kilogram",
        "defaultQuantity": 1
    },
```

If product, for example `kartoffel` has `refType` = `synonym`, synonym search method will take all properties from the product specified in `ref`. This process repeats reccursively until `refType`, `ref` is missing or `refType` != `synonym`.

### GUI description

Main component is `App` class from `src/App.js`. All children components are located in `src/Components/`, CSS files are in `src/Styles/`.

`App` has two children components `AddProductForm` and `ProductList` for displaying input field and current product list respectively.

`ProductItem` component is a common component for suggestions and `ProductList`.

`ModalWindow` component is a pop-up window with suggestions table.

`CartSmile` is an animated SVG graphic for empty `ProductList`.

## Dependancies

### Functionality

-   [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) (base framework)
-   [fuzzball](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuzzball) (fuzzy search)

### UI and Animations

-   [react-pose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pose) (UI animation)
-   [popmotion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/popmotion) (SVG animation)
-   [flubber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flubber) (SVG animation)
-   [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) and [react-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap) (layout)
-   [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) and [react-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome) (icons)

## Installation

All dependancies are managed by npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Run locally:

```bash
npm run
```

Run tests, tests are currently covering only functionality - Helper scripts.

```bash
npm test
```


Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Project can be deployed on [Zeit.co](https://zeit.co). Just use [CLI utility](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli) and run `now` to deploy.

## TODO

1. Autocomplete should suggest more than 1 entry
2. Similar quantity types such as kg and g should be combined together.
3. Suggestions should probably implemented using API
4. Should be possible to edit quantities by typing amount
5. ...
